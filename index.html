                        Well this one is pretty straight forward. You will be part of a group and all of you will be released in the wild to fend for yourself.<br>
                        I know, it may remind you of a movie out there but i know, the hunger is real and trust me, it is no game. People will actually kill for food.<br>
                        Are you up for it?
